This org "file-tools" contains nifty file utlities I've created to solve problems I've had. Some, like the image compression script, I use every day. These tools primarily help me solve issues related to the following apps I use: Obsidian, FS Notes, Google Drive, Raindrop.io.

- 🗜️ Image compression
- 📆 Date alteration File redating
- 📁 Directory content summarization
