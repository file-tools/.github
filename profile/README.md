This org "file-tools" contains nifty file utlities I've created to solve problems I've had. Some, like the image compression script, I use every day. These tools primarily help me solve issues related to the following apps I use: Obsidian, FS Notes, Google Drive, Raindrop.io.

- Image compression
- File redating
- Directory content summarization
- File format conversion - CSV to MD
